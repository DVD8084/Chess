# Chess
A collection of rather weird and sometimes straight up absurd chess variants.

A lot of variants in this app have been taken from (or partially inspired by)
[this page](http://absurdopedia.net/wiki/Форсированные_шахматы "Форсированные шахматы - Абсурдопедия").
(Please note that the page is in Russian, so some translation shenanigans may be required in order to fully understand it.)

Written using [imgui-java](https://github.com/SpaiR/imgui-java "imgui-java on GitHub") and a bit of majyyk. Have fun playing!
